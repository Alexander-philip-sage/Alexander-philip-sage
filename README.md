## Open Source Work
[EC Program](https://github.com/Alexander-philip-sage/ecprogram) - Webscraping a non-profit asked me to work on for free. It became a small POC to convince leadership to change their standard operating proceedures and integrate more software into their pipeline.

Argonne National Lab work was all open source as it was publicly funded research. Some examples of my work there was contributing to or making these repos: [mb_aligner](https://github.com/Alexander-philip-sage/mb_aligner), [n_template_match_gpu](https://github.com/Alexander-philip-sage/n_template_match_gpu), [rh_renderer](https://github.com/Alexander-philip-sage/rh_renderer), [ffn](https://github.com/Alexander-philip-sage/ffn)

## Work Products
[Work Products](https://github.com/Alexander-philip-sage/work_products) - Some code that I have created to accomplish deliverables. The deliverables and data are retained IP of the clients but the code was retained as my IP to share publicly.
